# Java8
This repository serves as a collection of examples, utilities, and code snippets specifically focused on Java 8 features. Java 8 introduced significant enhancements to the language, such as lambdas, streams, and functional interfaces and other API features.

Features:

Lambdas and Functional Interfaces: Explore various examples and use cases of lambda expressions and functional interfaces. Understand how these powerful constructs can simplify code and enable functional programming paradigms in Java.

Streams API: Dive into the Streams API, which enables efficient processing of collections and aggregate operations using functional-style operations. Discover common patterns and best practices for leveraging streams to write concise and readable code.

Date and Time API: Learn about the new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8, which provides improved date and time handling capabilities. Explore examples demonstrating the usage of the java.time package and its classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime.

Optional Class: Understand the Optional class and its benefits in dealing with null values. Discover how to use Optional effectively to avoid NullPointerExceptions and write more robust code.

Default Methods: Explore default methods in interfaces and how they can be used to add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking the implementations. Understand their impact on multiple inheritance and when to use them.

Method References: Learn about method references and their role in simplifying lambda expressions by referring to existing methods. Explore the different types of method references and how to use them in various scenarios.

New APIs and Features: Get familiar with other new APIs and features introduced in Java 8, such as the CompletableFuture API, new security enhancements, enhancements to the Collections API, and improvements in the Concurrency API.
